A gallery + reserve-'sell' system to order photos.

Objectives:
----


* Cool. By using [boring tech](https://boringtechnology.club/), this should be easy to use, install and deploy.
* Handle a photo gallery, with most of the expected features: image listing, image detail page / info, read-parse exif and display a subset. Render a low res version of the original.
* Handle a photo 'store', Except for Payment. 'Cuz payment iz hard. A base use case is redemption of gift cards.
* Allow for some concept of 'account'.
